# 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design

This project explores the fundamentals of web infrastructure design, starting from a simple web stack to a secured and monitored distributed web infrastructure. The goal is to understand the components involved in making a web application accessible and reliable.

## Overview

- Task 0: Design a simple web stack for `www.foobar.com`.
- Task 1: Expand the design to a distributed infrastructure with load balancing.
- Task 2: Implement security and monitoring measures for the distributed web infrastructure.

## Technologies

- Web server: Nginx
- Application server: Custom app server (details depend on the specific project setup)
- Database: MySQL
- Monitoring: Sumologic (or similar)
- Security: SSL/TLS, Firewalls

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of web servers, application servers, and databases.
- Familiarity with DNS, SSL/TLS, and firewall concepts.
- Diagramming tool for designing infrastructure layouts.

## Setup and Usage

1. Review each task's requirements and design considerations.
2. Create diagrams using a whiteboard or software tool of your choice.
3. Document your design decisions and setup in the respective task files within this repository.
